# COMP61542 TDD step-by-step example

## Adapted from Test-Driven Development By Example, Kent Beck.

## Robert Haines, University of Manchester, 2014

### Running these examples
#### From a terminal

1.  Add the 'src' directory to the python library search path:

        $ export PYTHONPATH=`pwd`/src

1.  Run the tests:

        $ python test/test_fibonacci.py

#### Within Eclipse

1.  Open up the project properties and add the 'src' directory to its
    `PYTHONPATH`. How you do this will depend on which plugin you are using
    for python development within Eclipse.

1.  Right-click on 'test_fibonacci.py' in the 'test' directory and select
    'Run As -> Python Unit Test'. Again this may differ depending on which
    plugin you are using.
